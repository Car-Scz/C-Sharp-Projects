# C-Sharp-Projects and Console apps

These are some small projects I've written using C# and .NET Framework. I have also 
written a number of console apps to illustrate my understanding of C# functionality.

Projects:

•	Anonymous Income Comparison Project

  This project is a MVC console application that takes user’s input of an hourly rate
	and hours worked per week for two persons.  Math and Comparison operators are used 
	to identify and state which of the persons makes the higher salary.

•	Car Insurance-Approval Project

	Using a MVC console application, a basic car insurance approval screen asks 
	questions based on business rules and then makes a determination.  The user is 
	then informed if the applicant is qualified or not.

•	Car Insurance-Quote Project

	This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website.  It 
	takes user’s input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business 
	logic.  There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that 
	have been issued.

•	Shipping Quote Project

	Using a MVC console application, a basic shipping quote screen asks for the 
	package’s dimensions and weight. A determination is made based on business rules 
	logic and the user is informed of the shipping quote.

•	Tech Academy-Daily Report Project

	This project creates a Student Daily Report in a MVC console app which collects the 
	responses of a student and thanks the student for completing the form.

•	Students Project

	A basic MVC Entity Framework console app creates a basic Student database using 
	classes and a class context object.  Once the database and tables have been 
	generated, one student is added.

•	Contoso University Tutorial Project

	Contoso University s a very comprehensive Project that was undertaken to expand 
	my knowledge of C#, Entity frameworks, and the Code First approach. After the models
	were created, the basic CRUD views were created.  Functionality was added to the Index 
	view including searching, sorting, and pagination. Connection Resiliency and concurrency
	was then eplored and migrations were enabled. Additional models were added and reading
	and updating related data was implemented. Using async and stored procedures was explored.
	Finally, inheritance was added to the data model.
